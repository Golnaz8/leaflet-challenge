# leaflet-challenge

## Overview

This project visualizes global earthquake data using the Leaflet.js library and the USGS GeoJSON API. It maps earthquake locations, displaying them as circle markers where the size reflects the earthquake magnitude and the color indicates the depth.

This visualization provides an intuitive way to understand earthquake distributions worldwide, helping the public and government organizations better understand earthquake activity.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies:

- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the web application, ensuring a user-friendly layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Enables dynamic updates and interactivity within the dashboard, such as responding to user input.
- **D3.js**: Facilitates data fetching from the JSON dataset and manipulation of the DOM to display metadata and update charts.
- **Leaflet.js**: A JavaScript library used for creating interactive maps, enabling visualization of geographical data and enhanced user interaction with map elements.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
